# The Climate Cost of Fuel Use in African Buildings

## Overview 
Through this project, the ten most populous African countries are visualized in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The dashboard developed, along with the accompanying article, attempts to provide a window into how fuel use in commercial and residential buildings affects the environment. The project uses data collected by Climate Trace, a global non-profit coalition, created to make meaningful climate action faster and easier by independently tracking GHG emissions from various sectors and regions using satellites and other remote sensing technologies.
